knowledge.py

Read side of the self-learning pipeline.

ticket_analyzer.py has always mined closed tickets into
`knowledge_sections`, and clickup_knowledge.py now does the same for
closed ClickUp tasks. Nothing ever read either one. The only consumer was
intake.py, which loaded knowledge_book/sams_voice.md from local disk at
import time, and that path never worked in production for two reasons:

  * the dyno filesystem is ephemeral, so a generated file is wiped on the
    next restart or deploy, and
  * a prompt assembled at import time cannot pick up a regeneration
    without a restart anyway.

So this module reads from Postgres, at request time, behind a short TTL
cache. Regenerate the knowledge book and every surface picks it up within
the cache window, no deploy and no restart.

Usage from any drafting surface:

    system = knowledge.augment_system_prompt(SYSTEM_PROMPT)

Everything degrades to the unmodified prompt: no database, no sections,
or a query failure all return the base prompt unchanged.
