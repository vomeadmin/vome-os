weekly_engineering_report.py

Two Slack reports on the engineering ClickUp board, both READ ONLY.

    Friday  (close the week)  -- what went out versus what came in, plus the
                                 week-over-week completed trend.
    Monday  (open the week)   -- what is on the plate right now, and what moved
                                 over the weekend.

Scheduled from main.py. Both are also triggerable by hand:
    POST /ops/reports/engineering   {"kind": "friday", "dry_run": true}

WHY TWO REPORTS AND NOT ONE
    They are different documents. Friday is retrospective and carries no asks,
    because nobody can action anything at 5pm on a Friday, and a "your
    pile grew" message heading into a weekend has no outlet. Monday is the
    actionable one.

THE FOUR THINGS THAT KEEP THE NUMBERS HONEST

 1. ClickUp's own open/closed flag is useless here. "awaiting client response",
    "sleeping", "declined" and "on prod" are all type "done" on this board, so
    include_closed=false STILL returns them. Buckets come from
    status_constants.report_bucket(), never from ClickUp's flag.

 2. "on prod" and "Closed" are ONE outcome. A task set to on prod auto-advances
    to Closed once the client is emailed, so on prod is a staging state. Both
    map to BUCKET_SHIPPED and a task that makes the whole trip inside one
    window is counted once.

 3. Flow comes from diffing snapshots, not from the API. ClickUp cannot answer
    "which tasks moved out of awaiting-client this week": time_in_status gives
    durations, not transition dates, and date_done is overwritten as a task
    advances. So every run snapshots the board, and flow is snapshot(N-1)
    versus snapshot(N). Week one therefore has standing figures only, which is
    reported honestly rather than filled in with a guess.

 4. Per-engineer columns do not sum to Total. Most tasks carry both engineers,
    so a per-person figure means "involved in", not "owns". Every table prints
    a shared count so the gap is explainable instead of looking like a bug.

DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE REPORT
    "escalated" tasks are Sam's to action, not the engineers', so they are
    bucketed as other and never counted in the plate total.

# Backlog is, in ClickUp's own words, "worth building, waiting for the right

# them as load triples the plate and contradicts what the engineers see in
# their own ClickUp views.
#
# Measured 2026-08-18: space-wide active gave Sanjay 34 / OnlyG 33, while their
# Priority Queue views showed 12 / 17. Scoping to Priority Queue (and excluding
# subtasks, below) reproduces the views exactly.
#
# The fetch itself is scoped with list_ids[], so intake and backlog tasks
# never enter the report at all. Verified 2026-08-18 that list_ids[] really
# does filter (133 tasks, all Priority Queue) unlike date_closed_gt, which
# is silently ignored. standing["backlog"] therefore reads 0 and is not
# rendered; it stays in the figures so a future run with a wider
# ENG_REPORT_WORKING_LISTS still reconciles.
