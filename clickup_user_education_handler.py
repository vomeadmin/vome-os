"""
clickup_user_education_handler.py

Handles ClickUp taskStatusUpdated -> "user education".

When an engineer sets a task to "user education", the dev has concluded
the user is misunderstanding how a feature works (or the steps), and the
ticket just needs a clear explanation of how it actually works and what
they can do -- not a code fix and not a request for more info.

  1. Fetch the linked Zoho ticket + the dev's ClickUp notes (the explanation)
  2. Review the thread: has this same explanation already been sent?
  3. If still needed: draft a friendly, plain-language explanation (signed
     Vic) and AUTO-SEND it to the client
  4. Treat the explanation as the resolution: close the ClickUp task and the
     Zoho ticket (a later client reply reopens the Zoho ticket as normal)
  5. If already explained -> skip the email and post a Slack note instead; if
     it can't auto-send -> fall back to a Slack review draft

Mirrors clickup_waiting_client_handler.py and reuses its plumbing; only the
draft tone (educate, don't request) and the post-send outcome (close, don't
park) differ.
