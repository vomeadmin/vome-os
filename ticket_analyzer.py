"""
ticket_analyzer.py

Batch analysis of Zoho Desk tickets to build the Vome Knowledge Book.

This script:
1. Fetches all tickets from Zoho Desk in batches (respecting rate limits)
2. Extracts full conversation threads (client messages + Sam's responses)
3. Runs Claude analysis on each ticket to extract patterns
4. Stores results in PostgreSQL (analyzed_tickets table)
5. After all tickets are analyzed, generates the Knowledge Book sections

The Knowledge Book is a living training document organized by category:
- Sam's voice and tone patterns
- Category-specific response patterns (bugs, billing, auth, etc.)
- Common scenarios with example responses
- FAQ entries (what to say for common questions)
- Decision patterns (when to escalate, when to answer directly)

Run this script to process historical tickets:
    python ticket_analyzer.py              # bounded run
    python ticket_analyzer.py --all        # no ceiling
    python ticket_analyzer.py --limit 300

It tracks progress in the database, so it's safe to restart --
it will pick up where it left off. run_weekly_knowledge_refresh() is the
scheduled entry point: it analyses newly closed tickets, mines newly
closed ClickUp tasks (clickup_knowledge.py), regenerates the book and
drops the read-side cache.

Postgres is the authoritative store. `knowledge_sections` is what
knowledge.py reads into live prompts; the markdown under knowledge_book/
is a local debugging convenience only, because the app runs on an
ephemeral filesystem where generated files do not survive a restart.

BOOK_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are creating a section of the Vome Support Knowledge Book -- a living training guide for support agents (both human and AI) based on {ticket_count} real support tickets handled by Sam, the CEO.

SECTION: {section_title}
CATEGORY: {category}

Here are the analyzed tickets for this section:

{ticket_summaries}

Based on these real tickets, write a comprehensive training section that includes:

1. **Overview** -- What this category covers, how common it is
2. **Sam's Approach** -- How Sam handles these tickets (tone, style, specific phrases he uses)
3. **Common Scenarios** -- The specific situations that come up, with Sam's actual response patterns
4. **Example Responses** -- 3-5 templated responses based on Sam's real language (not generic -- use his actual phrases and style)
5. **Key Decision Points** -- When to answer directly vs create a ticket vs escalate
6. **Red Flags** -- Things to watch for that need special handling
7. **FAQ Entries** -- Common questions with answers based on how Sam handles them

IMPORTANT:
- Use Sam's actual language and phrases where possible
- Be specific, not generic. "Sam says 'Let me take a look'" is better than "Respond warmly"
- Include both English and French response patterns if French tickets exist
- Note any patterns that have changed over time (features that were added, issues that were fixed)
- Flag any responses that reference features or behaviors that may have changed

Write in markdown format. This will be read by both humans and AI agents."""


ENGINEERING_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are writing the "How these issues get resolved" section of the Vome Support Knowledge Book, from {task_count} finished engineering tasks.

Each entry below is a real closed task: what a client reported, what it turned out to be, and how it was resolved.

{task_summaries}

Write a training section that a support agent (human or AI) reads before drafting a reply. Include:

1. **Recurring issues** -- the problems that come up again and again, what they look like from the client's side, and what they usually turn out to be
2. **Diagnostic questions that work** -- the questions that actually narrow these down, grouped by symptom
3. **Safe client-facing explanations** -- how to describe each recurring cause to a client, in plain warm language with zero internal detail
4. **User education patterns** -- the cases that were not bugs at all, and how the client was walked through the right way to do it
5. **Where to be careful** -- issues where the obvious answer is wrong, or where support should confirm before promising anything
6. **Article gaps** -- topics that keep generating tickets and have no help center article

Rules:
- Ground every claim in the entries above. If something appears once, say so rather than presenting it as a pattern.
- Never include internal engineering detail that would be unsafe to repeat to a client: no code, no file names, no engineer names.

TASKS IN THIS BATCH:

{task_summaries}

Extract, in compact markdown, only what these tasks actually show:

- **Issues**: what the client experienced, one line each, grouped when two tasks are the same underlying problem
- **Causes**: what each turned out to be. Write "not stated" where the task never says.
- **Diagnostic questions**: the questions that narrowed it down, phrased so support could ask them again
- **Safe explanations**: how the cause was described to the client, with no internal detail
- **User education**: the cases that were not bugs, and what the client was actually shown
- **Careful**: where the obvious answer was wrong
- **Article gaps**: topics flagged as needing a help center article

Rules:
- Only what is in these tasks. Where a cause is not stated, say so rather than inferring one.
- Mark repetition, for example "(4 tasks)". The merge pass uses that to tell a pattern from a one-off.
- No code, no file names, no engineer names.

1. **Recurring issues** -- the problems that come up again and again, what they look like from the client's side, and what they usually turn out to be
2. **Diagnostic questions that work** -- grouped by symptom
3. **Safe client-facing explanations** -- each recurring cause in plain warm language, zero internal detail
4. **User education patterns** -- the cases that were not bugs, and how the client was walked through it
5. **Where to be careful** -- where the obvious answer is wrong, or support should confirm before promising
6. **Article gaps** -- topics that keep generating tickets with no help center article

Rules:
- Merge duplicates and lead with what appears most often. Where the notes carry counts, weight by them.
- Keep a one-off only if it is genuinely instructive, and mark it as rare.

    cannot start another one until tomorrow. The scheduled job never
