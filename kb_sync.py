"""
kb_sync.py

Nightly sync of Zoho Desk KB articles into Postgres (kb_articles table).

This script:
1. Fetches all KB categories from Zoho Desk
2. Fetches all articles in each category
3. UPSERTs article content into Postgres -- only changed rows are
   touched (compared by Zoho's modifiedTime).
4. Deletes any rows whose article was removed from Zoho, but ONLY when
   the fetch completed cleanly (see LAST_FETCH_COMPLETE below).

Only Published articles are indexed. Drafts and unpublished articles
live at portal URLs that 404 for clients, so quoting them would send a
customer to a dead link.

Deletion safety: the delete step removes every row whose id was not seen
during the fetch. If a category errors mid-run, or an article's detail
call fails, those ids are missing from the seen set and a blind delete
would silently wipe them from the agent's knowledge. So the fetch tracks
its own completeness and the delete is skipped whenever anything failed.

At runtime, intake.py queries kb_articles via Postgres FTS to find
relevant articles for the current conversation -- the full article
body is fed into the prompt so Claude can paraphrase real instructions
instead of guessing from titles.

Schedule: nightly via APScheduler (see main.py).
Manual: `python kb_sync.py` to sync, `python kb_sync.py --status` to
inspect index health.
