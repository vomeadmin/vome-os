# Vic Support Workflows — Reference & Change Log (June 2026)

This document explains how the Vome support agent ("Vic") automates ticket
handling, and **why** each piece works the way it does. It captures the
June 2026 build-out that turned several human-reviewed draft flows into
sender-aware auto-send flows, centralized status/signature handling, and wired
the new ClickUp status board.

Audience: a future engineer or assistant continuing this work. It assumes no
prior context from the chat in which these changes were made.

---

## 1. The big picture

The agent is a FastAPI app (`main.py`) that reacts to webhooks from **Zoho Desk**
(the client-facing helpdesk), **ClickUp** (the engineering task board), and
**Slack** (the team's control surface). It uses Claude to classify tickets,
draft client replies, and make a few narrow "should we send this?" judgments.
Zoho is the client system of record; ClickUp is the engineering system of
record; Slack is the real-time human layer.

There are **two parallel reply paths** in the codebase — important context:

- **Webhook + Slack path** (`main.py` → handlers → `slack_reply_handler.py`):
  the live production flow. Everything in this document is about this path.
- **`/ops` Command Center** (`ops/` package, a React SPA + REST API): a separate
  dashboard/draft path. It was **not** migrated in this build-out and still
  references the old status vocabulary — see [§9 Open follow-ups](#9-open-follow-ups).

### The sender model (the core idea)

Client emails are signed by one of two "senders":

- **Vic** — the agent itself. Used for the **two auto-send categories** that go
  out **without human review**:
  1. **On-prod resolution replies** (engineer marks a fix live → client is told
     it's resolved).
  2. **Engineer-triggered needs-client-info requests** (engineer needs detail
     from the client → Vic asks for it).
- **Sam** — signed `Sam | Vome team`. Used for **everything a human reviews
  before it goes out** (new-ticket drafts, client-reply drafts, clarifying or
  feature replies in a sprint).

Effectively: *if it auto-sends, it's from the Vome team ("Vome team", since
2026-10-23); if a human reviews it, it's from
Sam.* A small set of pre-existing automated emails keep their legacy
signatures (see [§4](#4-signatures-signaturespy)).

---

## 2. The ClickUp status board (source of the triggers)

The Priority Queue list (ClickUp space `90114113004`, list `901113386257`) uses
these statuses. Engineers move tasks between them; several drive webhook
automation:

| Status | Who sets it | What it triggers |
|---|---|---|
| `queued` | system / resurface | — |
| `in progress` | engineer | — |
| `needs client info` | engineer | **Auto-sends a Vic info request** → parks |
| `escalated` | engineer | **Posts an escalation card to #escalated-tickets** |
| `on dev` | engineer | — |
| `awaiting client response` | the agent (park state) | — (auto-resurfaces on client reply) |
| `sleeping` / `declined` | engineer / Sam | — |
| `on prod` | engineer | **Auto-sends a Vic resolution → closes ticket** |
| `Closed` | the agent | — |

> **Critical history:** the board was renamed to this vocabulary
> (`needs client info`, `escalated`, and a new `awaiting client response`
> column were added; the old `waiting on client` and `needs review` were
> removed) **before** the webhook code was updated. So for a while, setting
> `needs client info` or `escalated` triggered **nothing** — `main.py` was still
> matching the dead `waiting on client` / `needs review` names. Part of this
> build-out was rewiring those triggers. If you rename a board status again,
> you must update the matching constant in `status_constants.py` **and** the
> branch in `main.py`.

---

## 3. Status vocabulary — `status_constants.py`

All status strings were centralized into one module so a rename can't silently
miss a casing variant scattered across files. Five vocabularies live here; do
not conflate them:

1. **`CU_*`** — ClickUp status *names*, canonical lowercase, for **inbound
   matching**. Compare with `normalize_status(incoming) == CU_xxx`.
   Key ones: `CU_ON_PROD`, `CU_NEEDS_CLIENT_INFO` (`"needs client info"`),
   `CU_AWAITING_CLIENT` (`"awaiting client response"`), `CU_ESCALATED`
   (`"escalated"`), `CU_QUEUED`, `CU_IN_PROGRESS`, `CU_ON_DEV`.
2. **`CU_WRITE_*`** — exact strings we *send* to the ClickUp API. Casing is
   intentionally preserved per call site (ClickUp matches case-insensitively,
   but we keep the historical bytes). e.g. `CU_WRITE_CLOSED_TITLE = "Closed"`.
3. **`THREAD_*`** — values for our own `ticket_threads.status` column in
   PostgreSQL (internal state, not visible to anyone). e.g.
   `THREAD_WAITING_CLIENT = "waiting-client"` (the internal "parked" marker),
   `THREAD_ON_PROD_SENT`, `THREAD_ESCALATED`, `THREAD_CLOSED`.
4. **`ZOHO_*`** — Zoho Desk status display names we write, e.g.
   `ZOHO_AWAITING_CLIENT_RESPONSE = "Awaiting Client Response"`,
   `ZOHO_CLOSED`, `ZOHO_FINAL_REVIEW`. Plus **`ZNORM_*`** — the normalized
   lowercase keys used only by the dashboard scorer.
5. **`ACTION_*`** — Command Center action keys (`/ops` path only).

`normalize_status(value)` lowercases, unifies separators (`_`/`-`/spaces → one
space), and strips emoji/punctuation — so `"On Prod"`, `"on_prod"`, and
`"on prod ✅"` all resolve to `CU_ON_PROD`. **Inbound webhook matching in
`main.py` uses this normalizer.** (Note: `ops/tickets.py` deliberately does *not*
normalize — it matches raw lowercase — which is one reason the `/ops` dashboard
needs its own cleanup pass.)

---

## 4. Signatures — `signatures.py`

One sender-keyed source for the client-facing closing block.

- `signature(sender, lang="en")` → full closing block. Senders:
  - `vic` → `Best,\n\nVic\nsupport.vomevolunteer.com` (FR uses `Cordialement,`)
  - `sam` → `Best,\n\nSam | Vome team\nsupport.vomevolunteer.com` (FR `Cordialement,`)
  - `team` (`AUTO_SENDER`) → `Best,\n\nVome team\nsupport.vomevolunteer.com` (FR
    `Cordialement,\n\nÉquipe Vome`). Since 2026-10-23, every email sent without
    Sam's explicit approval uses it; `team_signed()` re-signs a sprint draft
    at an automatic send.
  - `legacy_vome_team` → `Best,\n\nVome team\n…` — preserves the old auto-ack /
    completeness-gate signature byte-for-byte.
  - `legacy_sam_support` → `Best,\n\nSam | Vome support\n…` — legacy.
- `signature_name(sender)` → just the name line (for prompt instructions that
  phrase the sign-off their own way).
- `sign_message(text, sender, lang)` → the workhorse for **model-generated
  drafts**. It:
  1. **Strips any trailing sign-off the model emitted** (defends against
     double-signing — closing words, name lines, the domain line, separators).
  2. Appends the correct signature.
  3. For **compound** output (a `DRAFT RESPONSE` section followed by an
     `AGENT ANALYSIS` section), it places the signature at the **end of the
     draft body, before the analysis** — so the client-facing portion is signed
     correctly and the internal analysis is untouched.

### Why the prompt was changed

`system_prompt.md` previously baked `Vome team` / `Sam | Vome support` closings
into the voice guidelines and every example. Because **one prompt feeds drafts
that need different signers**, the prompt now instructs the model to **write the
body only — no closing or signature** ("a signature is appended automatically").
The signature is then attached in code per sender. This is what makes one set of
voice rules able to produce both Vic and Sam emails.

`system_prompt.md` also gained a **`## SIGNATURES AND AUTO-SEND`** section that
documents: the two Vic auto-send categories; that everything else is
Sam-reviewed; the **No-Confirmation Rule** (see [§6](#6-needs-client-info-auto-send));
the **ClickUp status vocabulary**; and that **feature requests stay with Sam and
are never auto-acknowledged** (what's asked for may already exist).

### Which sites are signed how (wiring)

| Call site | Sender |
|---|---|
| `agent.process_ticket` (sprint analysis/draft) | `sam` |
| `agent.process_ticket_update` (client-reply draft) | `sam` |
| `on_prod_handler._generate_resolution_draft` | `vic` |
| `clickup_waiting_client_handler._generate_need_info_message` | `vic` |
| auto-ack templates, completeness-gate reply | `legacy_vome_team` (unchanged) |
| auth-bypass replies | raw legacy format (unchanged) |
| `ops/draft.py` (Command Center) | still model-emitted `Sam | Vome support` — **not migrated** |

---

## 5. On-prod auto-send — `on_prod_handler.py`

**Trigger:** ClickUp task → `on prod` (engineer ships the fix).
**Entry point:** `handle_on_prod(task_id, engineer_name)`.

### Flow
1. Post a brief alert to `#eng-alerts`.
2. Extract the linked Zoho ticket (the `Zoho Ticket Link` custom field). No
   linked ticket → stop after the eng-alert.
3. Set Zoho status → `Final Review` (interim).
4. Fetch the Zoho ticket + full conversation thread.
5. **Pre-send review** — `_assess_resolution_state(...)` (a Claude call) reads
   the thread and decides whether a "it's fixed" email is still needed.
6. **If already resolved** → **do not send.** Close the Zoho ticket + close the
   ClickUp task, and post a "closed, no email — already resolved" record to
   Slack.
7. **Otherwise** → generate a **surface-level** Vic resolution draft, **auto-send
   it to the client**, close Zoho (`Closed`) + ClickUp (`Closed`), and post a
   "sent (Vic)" record showing exactly what went out.
8. **Fallback:** if it can't auto-send (no contact email, empty draft, or a send
   error) it degrades to the **old Slack-review flow** (posts the draft with
   `confirm`/`send`/`cancel`, leaves Zoho in `Final Review`) — so nothing is
   ever silently dropped.

### Why the pre-send review exists
Sam sometimes replies to a client out-of-band (e.g. an urgent Slack thread)
and forgets to flip the ClickUp task. If an engineer later marks it `on prod`,
a naive auto-send would email a **near-duplicate** "it's fixed" note. The review
reads the thread first: if a prior team reply already confirmed the fix — or the
client themselves confirmed it's working — Vic skips the email and just closes.
The "fixed" email is deliberately **basic and non-technical** (an update was
made, it should be resolved, please check and let us know) — no cause, no fix
details.

### Safety / tie-breakers
- **Defaults to send** when the review is uncertain or errors (a missed update
  is worse than a rare redundant note; duplicates only happen when the review is
  *confident* a confirmation already went out).
- **Loop-safe:** the outbound email isn't a client reply (so the resulting
  `zoho-update` webhook is ignored), and closing the ClickUp task fires a
  `Closed` status webhook that matches no trigger branch. `main.py` dedups
  ClickUp webhooks for 5 minutes to absorb retries.

---

## 6. Needs-client-info auto-send — `clickup_waiting_client_handler.py`

**Trigger:** ClickUp task → `needs client info` (engineer needs detail from the
client). **Entry point:** `handle_needs_client_info(task_id, engineer_name)`.

> The filename is legacy (`clickup_waiting_client_handler.py`) from when this
> status was called "waiting on client"; the behavior is the needs-client-info
> flow.

### Flow
1. Pull **engineer notes** = the ClickUp task description + comments. These tell
   Vic *what information to ask for*.
2. Fetch the Zoho ticket + thread.
3. **Pre-send review** — `_assess_info_request_state(...)` (Claude) returns one
   of:
   - **`send`** — the needed info hasn't been requested yet → generate the Vic
     request, **auto-send** it, then **park**: ClickUp → `awaiting client
     response`, Zoho → `Awaiting Client Response`, tag the ticket, post a record.
   - **`skip_already_asked`** — we already asked and are still waiting → **no
     duplicate**; just park.
   - **`skip_already_answered`** — the client already provided it → **re-queue**
     the task to `queued` for the engineer; no email.
4. **Fallback:** can't auto-send → Slack review draft (`confirm`/`send`/`cancel`).

### The No-Confirmation Rule
A needs-client-info request must **never confirm, diagnose, or describe the bug.**
Vic reads the engineer's note only to learn *what to ask*, then translates it
into a neutral, client-friendly request. It must not echo internal findings,
root-cause theories, or whether something is in fact broken. (This rule lives in
`system_prompt.md` under `SIGNATURES AND AUTO-SEND` and is reinforced in the
draft prompt.)

### Park + resurface lifecycle
- Parked tasks sit at `awaiting client response` (a ClickUp "done"-group column
  Sam created so it can be hidden from the active dev view). Internally the
  thread is marked `waiting-client`.
- When the client replies, the Zoho update webhook runs `process_ticket_update`,
  which (for a `waiting-client` thread) **re-queues the task to `queued`** and
  **logs the client's reply as a ClickUp comment** ("Client replied: …") so the
  engineer sees it.

### Why "default to send"
Same logic as on-prod: a blocked engineer (we failed to ask) is worse than a
rare redundant ask, so the review only skips when confident.

## 6A. No-action client replies (courtesy acks) — `process_ticket_update`

**Trigger:** a genuine inbound client reply on `/webhook/zoho-update` (same
`_is_client_reply` filter). **No email is ever sent on this path** — it only
realigns the Zoho status to mirror the linked ClickUp task, so courtesy
messages ("thanks!") stop sitting on the New/Processing dashboard.

> **Critical fix (June 2026): the update webhook now gates on event type.**
> `/webhook/zoho-update` fires for **every** ticket change, not just replies —
> including a status/assignee edit Sam makes by hand. `process_ticket_update`
> re-derives "the client replied" from the **latest conversation entry**, so a
> manual change to a ticket whose last message is from the client was mistaken
> for a reply and had its status **restored** — fighting Sam in a
> `Closed → Processing` loop every time he closed it (the "Support Agent" actor
> in the history is the shared `admin@` account the app posts as, so both sides
> of the flip look like the same user). `main.py` now calls
> `process_ticket_update` **only** when `is_zoho_reply_event(event_type, id,
> ticketId)` is true — i.e. a thread-add (eventType contains "thread", or the
> reply ID is in `id` while the real ticket ID is in `ticketId`). A bare field
> update runs **only** `sync_zoho_to_clickup` (Zoho→ClickUp, which never writes
> the Zoho status). Covered by `test_closed_reply_guard.py`.

### Ordering (critical)
The no-action check runs **before** the existing classify / resurface / draft
logic in `process_ticket_update`. So a courtesy reply on an
`awaiting client response` task is intercepted and **never resurfaces the task**
and **never creates a draft**. Action-needed replies fall straight through to
the unchanged existing behavior.

### Detection (precision over recall)
1. **OOO / autoresponder guard** (`_looks_like_auto_reply`): an out-of-office is
   *not* treated as a reply at all → the update returns early, ticket untouched.
2. **Attachment guard**: any attachment on the reply → action-needed.
3. **Action-signal keyword guard** (`_ACTION_SIGNAL_RE`): any obvious signal
   (`?`, `but`, `also`, `still`, `not working`, `doesn't`, `error`,
   `how/when/why`, `can you`, `help`, `again`, …) forces action-needed even if
   the model disagrees.
4. **Classifier** (`_classify_no_action_reply`, a cheap Haiku call): returns
   no-action **only** for pure acks ("thanks", "got it", "ok", "will do",
   "sounds good", "I'll check later", "appreciate it", closing pleasantries).
   Defaults to action-needed on uncertainty or error.

A false "action-needed" is safe (it just runs the normal flow); a false
"no-action" could wrongly move a status — so every guard biases toward
action-needed.

> **Critical fix (June 2026): the classifiers were running blind.** All of the
> above guards read the reply text from `latest.get("content")` — but Zoho's
> conversations **list** endpoint returns reply threads with a `summary` field
> and **no `content`** (only *comments* carry `content`). So every client reply
> was judged as empty text / `"(no text content)"`. The keyword guard never
> matched, and the ack classifier defaulted toward "no new info." On a *resolved*
> ticket this silently **re-closed** a "it's still broken, please re-check" reply
> (real incident: ticket #7905). Two changes fixed it:
> 1. `_extract_reply_text(latest)` now falls back to `summary` (and strips HTML),
>    so the guards and classifiers see the words the client actually wrote — the
>    same content→summary fallback `_format_conversations` already used.
> 2. **Re-closing a closed ticket now requires `_is_confident_ack`** (in
>    `process_ticket_update`), not a bare ack classification. A closed-ticket
>    reply re-closes **only** when there is readable text, **no** attachments,
>    **no** action signal, **and** the model agrees it's a pure ack. Any doubt →
>    the ticket is **re-opened** and reprocessed so a human sees it. Per Sam: be
>    highly confident to auto-close, otherwise the reply won't be seen. Covered
>    by `test_closed_reply_guard.py`.

### What happens on a no-action reply (`_handle_no_action_reply`)
- **No draft, no resurface, no email.** ClickUp is left exactly as-is.
- **Escalated → skip entirely** (leave in Processing for Sam). Matches both
  `escalated` and legacy `needs review` via `normalize_status`.
- Otherwise read the **live** ClickUp status (`_get_clickup_status`) and set the
  Zoho status to mirror it — **status only, the Zoho owner is never touched** —
  via the plain-string `_set_zoho_ticket_status` helper (never the object form,
  which silently no-ops):

  | ClickUp status (new / legacy) | Zoho status |
  |---|---|
  | `closed` / `done` | Closed |
  | `on prod` | Closed |
  | `awaiting client response` / `waiting on client` | Awaiting Client Response |
  | `queued` / `in progress` / `on dev` | In Progress |
  | (no linked ClickUp task) | Closed |
  | anything else (`sleeping`, `needs client info`, …) | left unchanged |

- Every auto-handled reply is logged to **#vome-agent-log**
  (`SLACK_CHANNEL_AGENT_LOG`): ticket ID, reply text, the ClickUp state read,
  and the Zoho status set — so misclassifications are easy to catch.

### Why
Clients routinely reply "thanks!" after a ticket is effectively done. Those used
to linger in New/Processing — or worse, resurface an awaiting-client task or
generate a needless draft. Now they silently realign Zoho to whatever ClickUp
says (the source of truth for engineering state) and get logged, with no
client-facing email. It is the read-only counterpart to the manual Zoho→ClickUp
sync in §8.

## 6B. Stale awaiting-client sweep (`stale_waiting_client_sweeper.py`)

**Trigger:** APScheduler, 07:30 `America/Montreal`, daily (`main.py`).
**Entry point:** `run_stale_waiting_client_sweep()`.
**Manual trigger:** `POST /ops/sweeps/stale-waiting-client` with
`{"dry_run": true}`. **Run history:** `GET /ops/sweeps/runs`.
**Backlog drain:** `POST /ops/sweeps/stale-waiting-client/drain` (see below).

§6 parks tickets on the client, but nothing ever un-parked them when the client
simply never answered, and `ops/tickets.py::_fetch_zoho_active_tickets`
deliberately excludes `Awaiting Client Response` from the Command Center queue,
so the pile was invisible. This closes tickets that have sat there for 30+ days
with no client reply.

### Flow
1. Page Zoho for every ticket in `Awaiting Client Response` (status filter sent
   to Zoho **and** re-applied client-side, so an ignored query param cannot
   widen the sweep).
2. Per ticket, read the conversation and take the newest **outbound** email as
   the idle clock, plus the newest **inbound** one.
3. Decide: `close`, `skip_recent`, `skip_client_replied`, `skip_no_timestamp`,
   or `skip_clickup_busy`.
4. For each close (**no client email, see below**): Zoho `Closed` → internal
   note → the same note on ClickUp + `CLOSED` + resolution field →
   `ticket_threads` row updated to `closed` /
   `auto_closed_no_client_response`.
5. Post one Slack summary (`SLACK_CHANNEL_STALE_SWEEP`, falling back to
   #vome-agent-log) covering what closed, what was capped, and every skip
   bucket.

### The two rules that keep it safe
**Rule 1: never use `modifiedTime`.** It answers "when was this record last
edited", not "when did we last write to the client", and it moves on tag writes,
status writes, and every `sync_zoho_to_clickup` pass. Any of those resets the
idle clock on a ticket nobody actually replied to. Staleness therefore comes
from the newest outbound thread, falling back to
`ticket_threads.last_action_at` (when §6 parked it). If neither resolves, the
ticket is **skipped**, never closed on a guessed date.

> Honest footnote: the magnitude of this was never measured on real data. The
> MCP list endpoint does not return `modifiedTime` at all, so an attempt to
> quantify it in Aug 2026 measured nothing. The rule stands on what the field
> means, not on an observed failure.

**Rule 2: both systems must agree.** If Zoho says awaiting-client but the
ClickUp task is `in progress` / `on dev`, that is live dev work and closing Zoho
would kill the visible half of it. Those become a **status drift** warning in
the Slack report instead of a close. Same principle inside a single close: if
the Zoho status write fails, the ClickUp and DB writes are skipped, because
half-closing manufactures the exact drift this rule detects.

A client reply newer than our last email is also blocked
(`skip_client_replied`) and reported. Note that `_assess` checks "did they
reply" **before** the age window, so this bucket catches every parked ticket
with an unanswered reply, no matter how recent.

That mattered: the report originally called all of them webhook failures, which
was wrong for anything fresh and, because the list was unsorted and truncated
at ten, it displayed the *least* important members while hiding the genuinely
alarming ones. The report now splits the bucket on
`STALE_SWEEP_REPLY_ALERT_DAYS` (default 7), using days since **their** reply:

- **`Waiting on US`** (7+ days unanswered) is a service failure. Sorted longest
  wait first, top ten listed, remainder counted.
- **"replied recently, in flight"** (under 7 days) is a normal ticket. Counted
  only, never listed.

Every truncated list in the report now says how many it dropped, and a ticket
with no resolvable date renders as `(date unknown)` rather than `(0d)`, which
used to make an unknown date look brand new.

### The client is never emailed (policy, Aug 2026)
`STALE_SWEEP_SEND_CLOSING_EMAIL` **defaults to `false`** and the team's decision
is that it stays off: a stale ticket is closed **quietly on both platforms**,
with an internal note on each and nothing sent to the client.

The reasoning came out of the first live dry run: 314 eligible tickets with a
median idle time of 126 days. A closing note on a thread that went silent four
months ago is archaeology. It invites a reply wave on work nobody is tracking,
and it puts hundreds of messages through the support domain in one burst. The
fixed-template email code is still there behind the flag in case a courtesy
note is ever wanted for the fresh 30-day tier, but **turning it on is a
deliberate decision, not a default**, and
`test_client_email_is_off_by_default` pins that.

Every Slack report states which mode the run used, so the audit trail can never
be ambiguous about whether a batch emailed clients.

### Why closing is low risk anyway
A client reply on a closed ticket flips it back to Processing and resurfaces it
in Slack (§6A / `is_zoho_reply_event` → `process_ticket_update`). So a quiet
close is reversible by the client's own next message, without us having to
announce it.

### Rollout controls
`STALE_SWEEP_DRY_RUN` **defaults to `false`, so the daily job closes for real.**
It defaulted to `true` during the Aug 2026 rollout, because the first live run
would have hit the whole historical backlog at once. That backlog was cleared
via drain mode, so the guard became friction and the default was flipped. Set
`STALE_SWEEP_DRY_RUN=true` to put it back in report-only mode.

The **manual endpoint still previews by default**: `StaleSweepRequest.dry_run`
is `True`, so `POST /ops/sweeps/stale-waiting-client` with no body changes
nothing. Only the scheduled job and an explicit `dry_run: false` write.

`STALE_SWEEP_MAX_CLOSES` (default 25) caps a single run,
oldest tickets first, and the report says how many were left behind. Nothing is
capped silently: the 500-ticket paging cap is reported too.

The 07:30 job also claims the day in Postgres (`sweeper_runs`, via
`claim_sweeper_run`) before doing any work, so a web-process restart near the
trigger time cannot double-run it. `misfire_grace_time=1800` lets a restart
within 30 minutes still fire.

### Drain mode (clearing a backlog)
`POST /ops/sweeps/stale-waiting-client/drain` with `{"confirm": true}` loops the
normal batched sweep until the eligible pool is empty. Use it to clear a
historical pile; the daily job handles steady state.

It is deliberately NOT one big pass. A few hundred closes is ~4 write calls
each, which would blow past Zoho's per-minute ceiling, and a synchronous
request that long gets cut by the gateway. So the drain re-fetches the ticket
list each round (state moves between batches), pauses between them
(`STALE_SWEEP_DRAIN_PAUSE`, default 20s), and returns immediately while running
in the background. One Slack report per batch, then a final summary.

`confirm: true` is required and there is no dry-run drain: a dry run does not
shrink the pool, so the loop would never converge. Preview with the normal
endpoint first.

Four stop conditions, all reported: pool empty, **no progress** (tickets were
eligible but a whole batch closed nothing, so something is failing and
retrying would spin), `max_batches` (default 20), and `DRAIN_MAX_TOTAL`
(default 600 closes). The last batch is trimmed so the total ceiling is never
overshot.

### Manual setup required
The ClickUp resolution dropdown has no "no client response" option yet. Add it
by hand, then set `CLICKUP_RESOLUTION_NO_RESPONSE` to its option id. Until then
the field is deliberately left **unset** rather than mislabeled `completed`.

## 7. Escalations — `clickup_needs_review_handler.py`

**Trigger:** ClickUp task → `escalated`. **Entry point:**
`handle_escalated(task_id, engineer_name)`.

> Filename is legacy (was "needs review"); behavior is the escalation flow.

Posts a **structured escalation card** to the dedicated **#escalated-tickets**
Slack channel in real time, then marks the thread `escalated`. The card shows:
ticket #, task title, who escalated, account / tier / ARR, current assignee,
complexity, and Zoho + ClickUp links — with the channel thread as the discussion
space.

- Channel is read from `SLACK_CHANNEL_ESCALATIONS`, defaulting to `C0BB3JCT51A`
  (the "escalated tickets" channel). Override via env to move it.
- **Why a dedicated channel:** escalations are time-sensitive (engineer stuck,
  or — once built — a high-value client thread turning negative). A dedicated,
  escalations-only channel with Sam + both engineers keeps signal high and
  discussion in one place; ClickUp stays the system of record.
- The card is posted **without an @-mention** by default (the dedicated channel
  is already the signal). Adding `@Sam` / `@assignee` is a small change if wanted.

## 8. Zoho → ClickUp status sync — `agent.sync_zoho_to_clickup`

Runs on every `/webhook/zoho-update`. Keeps the ClickUp task in sync when a Zoho
ticket's status changes (e.g. Sam changes it by hand):

| Zoho status | ClickUp task | Thread |
|---|---|---|
| `Closed` / `Resolved` | → closed | `closed` |
| `Awaiting Client Response` | → `awaiting client response` (parked) | `waiting-client` |
| reassigned to Sam/Ron, or unassigned | → closed | — |

The `Awaiting Client Response` branch is checked **before** the assignee rules,
so a Sam-owned ticket set to awaiting is **parked, not closed** (the assignee
rule would otherwise close any non-engineer-owned task). Setting the thread to
`waiting-client` means a later client reply auto-resurfaces it to `queued` (same
machinery as §6).

This is the reverse direction of the auto-send flows: those push Zoho status
*from* the agent; this pulls a manual Zoho status change *into* ClickUp.

## 9. Configuration & setup

### Environment variables (key ones)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ZOHO_DESK_MCP_URL`, `ZOHO_CRM_MCP_URL`, `ZOHO_ORG_ID`
  (the org is `736165782`).
- `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
- `ZOHO_FROM_ADDRESS` — the address client emails are sent from.
- Slack channels: `SLACK_CHANNEL_SUPPORT_FINAL_REVIEW`,
  `SLACK_CHANNEL_VOME_TICKETS`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_FINISHED_TASKS`,
  `SLACK_CHANNEL_ESCALATIONS` (defaults to `C0BB3JCT51A`), etc.
- Stale awaiting-client sweep (§6B), all optional:
  `STALE_SWEEP_DRY_RUN` (default `false`; set `true` for report-only),
  `STALE_WAITING_DAYS` (30), `STALE_SWEEP_MAX_CLOSES` (25),
  `STALE_SWEEP_SEND_CLOSING_EMAIL` (**false**, and it stays that way),
  `STALE_SWEEP_THROTTLE` (0.4s between tickets),
  `STALE_SWEEP_DEPARTMENT_ID`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_STALE_SWEEP`,
  `STALE_SWEEP_REPLY_ALERT_DAYS` (7),
  `STALE_SWEEP_DRAIN_MAX_BATCHES` (20), `STALE_SWEEP_DRAIN_MAX_TOTAL`
  (600), `STALE_SWEEP_DRAIN_PAUSE` (20s),
  `CLICKUP_RESOLUTION_NO_RESPONSE` (needs manual ClickUp setup first).

### Webhooks
- **Zoho Desk** → `/webhook/zoho-ticket` (new ticket) and `/webhook/zoho-update`
  (updates, incl. status changes and client replies).
- **ClickUp** → `/webhook/clickup-status` (must subscribe to both
  `taskStatusUpdated` and `taskAssigneeUpdated`).
- **Slack** events → `/webhook/slack-events`.

### Slack app
No app/manifest/scope changes are needed to add a channel. The bot already uses
`chat:write`. To post to a **new** channel, the bot just needs to be a **member**
— `/invite` it into the channel. (A `not_in_channel` error in logs means it
wasn't invited.) This is the only manual step required for #escalated-tickets.

### ClickUp board
The Priority Queue must contain the status columns listed in [§2](#2-the-clickup-status-board-source-of-the-triggers).
If you rename one, update `status_constants.py` + the matching branch in
`main.py`.

## 10. How it was validated

Changes were dry-run against **real tickets** via the live Zoho/ClickUp data
(reading only — no emails sent, no statuses changed):

- **On-prod:** verified it **suppresses** a duplicate when the client already
  confirmed the fix, and **sends** a clean confirmation when only a generic ack
  had been sent.
- **Needs-client-info:** verified it **skips** (no duplicate) on tickets where
  repro steps / details had already been requested twice and were still pending
  (incl. a French thread), and **sends** a targeted question where none had been
  asked. Surfaced that the quality of the request tracks the quality of the
  engineer's note.
- `signatures.sign_message` was unit-tested for clean EN/FR drafts, the
  double-sign guard, and compound (draft + analysis) placement.
- **No-action replies (§6A):** the OOO guard, the action-signal keyword guard,
  and the ClickUp→Zoho mapping were validated against the real board statuses
  (incl. the escalated-skip and "unmapped → leave unchanged" cases). The
  classifier itself is a live Haiku call, backstopped by the deterministic
  guards and a default-to-action-needed.

All touched modules compile (`py_compile`) and pass `pyflakes` (no undefined
names / no new unused imports; remaining lint is pre-existing style).

## 11. Open follow-ups

1. **`/ops` Command Center is on the old vocabulary.** `ops/tickets.py` (dashboard
   filters), `ops/send.py` (status writes), and `ops/draft.py` still reference
   `waiting on client` / `needs review`, which no longer exist on the board. The
   dashboard won't categorize awaiting/escalated tasks correctly and
   `ops/send.py` could write an invalid status. Needs a dedicated migration to
   `needs client info` / `awaiting client response` / `escalated`.
2. **`ops/draft.py` still relies on a model-emitted signature** (`Sam | Vome
   support`) rather than `sign_message`. Migrate it to the programmatic signer.
3. **Automatic escalation is not built.** Escalated is engineer-triggered only.
   The SOP's rule — auto-escalate + ping Sam when an Enterprise/Ultimate or
   >$1,500 CAD ARR account's thread turns urgent/negative — needs: a
   sentiment/urgency signal (none exists today; there is no sentiment scoring),
   the tier/ARR available at send time (CRM enrichment is on the thread record),
   and **currency handling** (ARR is treated as a bare number today; CAD vs USD
   is not considered).
4. **Auto-acknowledgment survival is undecided.** The new-ticket auto-ack still
   sends on engineer-assigned tickets (legacy `Vome team` signature). Whether it
   stays is an open product decision. **Update (June 2026):** it is now
   **suppressed on agent-created tickets** — when Sam opens a ticket by hand in
   Zoho Desk on a client's behalf, no auto-ack fires so he controls the first
   reply. Detection is `_is_agent_created(source_type)` in `agent.py`, keyed on
   Zoho's `source.type == "SYSTEM"` (client-submitted email/web tickets carry
   their channel's type instead). The guard sits on the auto-ack call in
   `process_ticket`; the Slack draft, classification, and engineer assignment
   still run as normal.
5. **Optional @-mentions** on escalation cards (and possibly on-prod/needs-info
   records) if the dedicated channel isn't enough signal.

## 12. File map (what changed in this build-out)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `status_constants.py` | Central status vocabulary + `normalize_status()`. Added `CU_NEEDS_CLIENT_INFO`, `CU_AWAITING_CLIENT`, `CU_ESCALATED`, `THREAD_ESCALATED`. |
| `signatures.py` | Sender model + `sign_message()` (strip-then-append, compound-aware). |
| `system_prompt.md` | Removed baked-in signatures; added `SIGNATURES AND AUTO-SEND`, status vocabulary, No-Confirmation Rule, feature-request rule. |
| `main.py` | Webhook triggers rewired: `on prod` → on-prod; `needs client info` → needs-client-info; `escalated` → escalations. |
| `agent.py` | Programmatic Sam signature on sprint drafts; `sync_zoho_to_clickup` gained the `Awaiting Client Response` branch; resurface logs client reply as a ClickUp comment (`_add_clickup_comment`); **no-action courtesy-reply handler** (OOO guard + keyword guard + Haiku classifier → mirror Zoho to ClickUp, no email/draft/resurface) running before the resurface/draft logic. |
| `on_prod_handler.py` | Auto-send + close (Zoho + ClickUp) + pre-send resolution review + Slack record; Slack-review fallback. |
| `clickup_waiting_client_handler.py` | Needs-client-info auto-send + park + pre-send review (send/skip-asked/skip-answered) + fallback. |
| `clickup_needs_review_handler.py` | Escalation card → #escalated-tickets; trigger rewired to `escalated`. |
| `slack_reply_handler.py` | Manual-confirm path now writes `awaiting client response` (was the dead `WAITING ON CLIENT`). |
| `stale_waiting_client_sweeper.py` | **New (Aug 2026).** Daily 07:30 ET sweep closing 30-day-stale awaiting-client tickets (§6B). Dry-run by default. |
| `test_stale_waiting_client_sweeper.py` | Pins both safety rules for §6B (no `modifiedTime`, both systems must agree) plus the write ordering. Runs with pytest or `py test_stale_waiting_client_sweeper.py`. |
| `database.py` | Added the `sweeper_runs` table + `claim_sweeper_run` / `finish_sweeper_run` / `get_recent_sweeper_runs` (once-per-day lock for scheduled sweeps); `_row_to_dict` now exposes `last_action`, `last_action_at`, `updated_at`. |
| `ops/zoho_sync.py` | `RESOLUTION_MAP` gained `no_response` (env-configured, unset until the ClickUp option exists). |
| `ops/router.py` | `POST /sweeps/stale-waiting-client` (manual trigger, dry-run by default) and `GET /sweeps/runs`. |

*Last updated: August 2026 (added §6B, the stale awaiting-client sweep). If you change a workflow, update the matching section
here and the file map so this stays the single source of truth for the why.*
