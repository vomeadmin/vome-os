signatures.py

Single sender-keyed source for the client-facing email signature.

Today the signature is set in ~6 places with two different values:
  - "Vome team"          — system prompt + auto-acknowledgment templates
  - "Sam | Vome support" — slack_reply_handler, ops/draft, waiting-client

This module centralizes them so the upcoming auto-send work can flip the
signature per sender in ONE place.

BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING (this step):
    Nothing is wired to the new "vic"/"sam" senders yet. Every call site
    currently passes a "legacy_*" sender whose output reproduces that site's
    existing string byte-for-byte. The "vic"/"sam" entries are defined for
    the later flip and are intentionally unused for now.

Two accessors:
    signature(sender, lang="en") -> the full closing block a site emits
        (e.g. "Best,\\n\\nSam | Vome support\\nsupport.vomevolunteer.com").
        Used by sites that drop the whole block into the message/prompt.
    signature_name(sender) -> just the signer NAME line
        (e.g. "Sam | Vome support"). Used by prompt-instruction sites that
        phrase the sign-off their own way and only need the name, so their
        prompt text stays byte-identical.
